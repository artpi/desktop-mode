Reimagines the WordPress admin as a desktop OS with draggable windows and a dock. Per-user opt-in. By Automattic.

== Description ==

Desktop Mode renders /wp-admin as a desktop operating system. Admin screens open as draggable, resizable, minimizable windows on a desktop, with a left-edge dock built from the admin menu. The classic admin stays untouched for everyone else, and deactivating the plugin restores vanilla Core exactly.

Built and maintained by [Automattic](https://automattic.com) — the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack, WooCommerce, and Tumblr. Zero Core patches: every feature is wired through public WordPress hooks.

= Highlights =

* **Per-user opt-in.** An admin-bar toggle flips a user-meta flag; nobody else sees any change.
* **Window system.** Iframe windows load admin pages chromelessly. Native windows render directly in the parent DOM via a public registration API. Both share drag, resize, minimize, maximize, fullscreen, and detach-to-new-tab.
* **Dock + taskbar.** Left-edge dock for core menus; bottom macOS-style pill taskbar for plugin menus. Letter-badge icon fallback for plugins without icon art.
* **Virtual desktops ("Spaces").** Multiple desktops per user, each with its own window set. Overview grid surfaces the Spaces switcher and thumbnails.
* **Arrange & snap.** Cascade, Tile, Overview, Snap-to-grid. Plugins contribute custom entries.
* **Wallpaper & widget registries.** Server- and client-side registration. CSS presets plus canvas (WebGL/2D) wallpapers with collision-aware surface data for snow/rain/physics effects.
* **Desktop icons.** Wallpaper-layer shortcuts that open native windows or admin URLs.
* **AI Copilot (optional).** Cmd+K palette backed by an agentic loop with built-in search tools. Disabled until you supply an API key. See "External services" below.
* **Slash commands & palettes.** Public registration APIs for plugin authors.
* **Cross-frame drag bridge.** Media-library attachments drag across iframe boundaries.
* **Session persistence.** Window stack (including desktops, focus, state) restored across reloads.
* **i18n.** Full gettext coverage across PHP and TypeScript; Spanish translation shipped.

= For plugin authors =

Desktop Mode is built to be extended. Every significant behavior is hookable — add a desktop icon, register a dock item, gate desktop mode by role, react to window events, or register a native window, all from your own plugin with zero patches here.

Comprehensive PHP and JavaScript hook surface, plus stable `desktop_mode_register_*` functions for windows, widgets, wallpapers, icons, window tabs, commands, settings tabs, and AI tools. See the [developer docs on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/desktop-mode/tree/trunk/docs).

= External services =

This plugin's optional **AI Copilot** sends data to **OpenAI** (`https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`) when, and only when, an administrator configures an OpenAI API key in **Settings → AI**. With no key configured, no external requests are made.

When the AI Copilot is enabled and a user invokes it (via Cmd+K or the slash-command palette):

* **What is sent:** the user's prompt, the conversation history for the active session, the chosen model identifier (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`), and tool-call metadata. The plugin's built-in tools (`search_posts`, `search_pages`, `search_comments`) may include excerpts of the matching posts/pages/comments in tool results, which are then sent back to OpenAI as part of the agentic loop.
* **When it is sent:** on user-initiated AI requests, and (if enabled) on `save_post`, term-save, and comment-save hooks for auto-analysis. Auto-analysis runs server-side as part of the post-save flow.
* **Why it is sent:** to obtain model completions and tool-call decisions that drive the AI Copilot.
* **Who provides the service:** OpenAI, L.L.C. — see the [OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/) and the [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/).

The AI Copilot's provider layer is also extensible: third-party plugins may register additional providers via `desktop_mode_register_ai_provider()`. Those providers may send data to other endpoints; review each plugin's own privacy disclosure separately.

No other external services are contacted by this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress.
3. Click the **desktop** icon in the admin bar's top-right corner. The admin reloads inside the desktop shell.
4. Click the same icon again at any time to return to the classic admin.

= Optional: enable the AI Copilot =

1. Open **Settings → AI** inside desktop mode.
2. Paste an OpenAI API key and pick a model.
3. Press **Cmd+K** (or **Ctrl+K**) anywhere in desktop mode to open the AI palette.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this change anything for users who don't opt in? =

No. The classic admin is untouched until a user toggles desktop mode on for themselves. Deactivating the plugin restores vanilla Core exactly.

= Does the plugin require an external service to function? =

No. The desktop shell, windowing, dock, taskbar, virtual desktops, widgets, wallpapers, and all extension APIs work entirely on-site. The AI Copilot is the only feature that contacts an external service, and it is disabled until an administrator configures an API key. See "External services" in the description.

= Does it patch WordPress core? =

No. Every feature is wired through public WordPress actions and filters.

= How do I disable desktop mode for my user? =

Click the desktop icon in the admin bar a second time to flip the toggle off. The plugin can also be deactivated globally from the Plugins screen.

= Where is the developer documentation? =

In `docs/` inside the plugin, and on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/desktop-mode/tree/trunk/docs). The hook reference, JavaScript reference, bridge protocol, and copy-paste examples all live there.

== Screenshots ==

1. The desktop shell — wallpaper, dock, taskbar, and a window with the admin loaded inside it.
2. Multiple windows open across virtual desktops (Spaces).
3. The AI Copilot Cmd+K palette in action.
4. Custom wallpapers and widgets registered by a plugin.
5. The Arrange menu — Cascade, Tile, Overview, Snap to grid.

== Credits ==

Desktop Mode is brought to you by [Automattic](https://automattic.com). The plugin is open source under GPLv2-or-later; contributions are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/desktop-mode).

= Third-party libraries =

The plugin bundles the following third-party JavaScript library, loaded on demand only when a feature that needs it is in use:

* **[PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)** (MIT License) — used by the interactive **OS Settings → About** scene, the **Content Graph** window, and built-in canvas wallpapers (e.g. the animated WordPress logo). PixiJS is loaded from the plugin's own `assets/vendor/` directory; no CDN requests are made.
