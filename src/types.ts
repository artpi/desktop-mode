	 *   - **`desktop_mode_register_window()` (PHP)** — the shell clones

	 *   - **`windowManager.open({ native: true, render })` (raw JS)** —
	 *     no template plumbing exists at this layer. The body is
	 *     empty; the callback constructs the DOM directly.
	 *
	 * The second argument is populated when `wp.desktop.registerWindow()`

	 * legacy `windowManager.open()` callers still receive `body`
	 * only; in that case use `wp.desktop.windowManager.getById(

	 * **Loading lifecycle.** Every native window starts in the

	 * the overlay automatically:
	 *
	 *   - When `render` returns a non-Promise value, on the next

	 *     synchronous DOM mutations a chance to settle).

	 *     resolves. The promise's resolved value is treated as the
	 *     teardown function (or void) — same contract as the
	 *     synchronous return.
	 *   - When the plugin calls `ctx.window.markReady()` directly,
	 *     immediately. Useful for non-promise async (event listener
	 *     based loading) or for re-readying after a refetch
	 *     triggered by `ctx.window.markLoading()`.
